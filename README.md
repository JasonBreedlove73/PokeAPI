In this assignment I was asked to make a simple website using asynchonous JavaScript. 
The assignment asked to make a page that interacts with the PokeAPI to display basic pokemon information.
The website had to include an input box where the users can type in a pokemon name.
Below the input box I added a search button that fetches the information from the PokeAPI and returns it to the webpage using JavaScript.
Once the information is returned the pokemon name and image displays.
If the pokemon is not found an error message displays asking the user that it was not found and to choose another name.
In this project we were suppose to use minimal HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
